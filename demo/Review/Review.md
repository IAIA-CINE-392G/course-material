**Part 1**  
1. Create a setup and draw function  
2. Set the size of the window to 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels  
3. Set the background to black in the draw function  
4. Set the fill color to white  
5. Draw a circle using the ellipse function  
6. Set the circle's x position to half the screen's width  
7. Set the circle's y position to half the screen's height  
8. Set the circle's width and height to 50  



**Part 2.**
1. Create a for loop in the draw function  
2. Set the counter from 0 to 19  
3. Place the ellipse function in the for loop  
4. Change the y position of the ellipse to the for loop's counter and mulitply it by 50  



**Part 3.**
1. Make a global variable of type float named xpos. Assign the value to 0  
2. Increment the variable by 1.0 in the draw function  
3. Change the circle's x position to the xpos variable
