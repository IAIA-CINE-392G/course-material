**Part 1: Draw**  
1. Create a setup and draw function  
2. Set the window size to 1000 by 500 
3. Set the background to black in the draw function  
4. Set the fill color to white  
5. Draw a square using the rect function  
6. Set the square's dimensions to 20

**Part 2: Repeat**  
1. Add a for loop to draw the square 100 times  
2. Use a variable named "i" as the loop's counter  
3. Set the square's x position to (i * 20)  

**Part 3: Animate**  
1. Make a global float variable named ypos with a value of 0.0  
2. Increment the variable by 1.0 at the end of the draw function  
3. Change the square's y position to the ypos variable
